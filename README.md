Hello!

Thank you for using my AI Water Usage Estimator tool!
This is my first project and I heavily relied on AI to walk me through from the very beginning with powershell
-------------------
These numbers are based off the tiktoken package which measures words-tokens when estimating water cost based off literature. 
It currently only functions on desktops and not mobile phones, but I'll be sure to push out an update very soon! 
I started this project, mainly because I wanted to see if it could be done, and to think of future applications (chrome extensions, ect.) and my passion for metrics and sustainability
