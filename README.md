Hello!
------------------
Thank you for using my AI Water Usage Estimator tool!
This is my first project, and I heavily relied on AI to guide me through the entire process using PowerShell and Python.
-------------------
These numbers are based on the tiktoken package, which measures word tokens when estimating water cost based on the literature. 
It currently only functions on desktops, but I'll be sure to push out an update very soon. 
I started this project mainly because I wanted to see if it could be done and to consider future applications (such as Chrome extensions), driven by my passion for metrics and sustainability.
